He brought with him a copy of Captain Nidever’s and Carl Dittman’s accounts of the discovery of the Lone Woman in 1853. Using the accounts, Woodward was able to find the approximate location where the Lone Woman was found in a small hut, or windbreak. He found a scattering of whalebones like the ones described as being part of the Lone Woman’s windbreak. From this discovery, Woodward believed he had found the remains of the Lone Woman’s actual hut.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In 1940, he returned and photographed the site as he found it. He then reconstructed part of the hut by standing the whalebones up on edge. He photographed his assistant sitting in the reconstructed hut. This looked a lot like the scene Carl Dittman may have observed when he first spied the Lone Woman.\\nUsing Woodward’s field notes and photographs, I was able to relocate this precise spot. There are still remains of whalebones at the site today. The location is on top of a sand dune at the northwest end of San Nicolas Island. There is evidence of previous occupation in the form of a midden deposit (trash or refuse heap).'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Based on my research, I agree with Woodward that this is likely the location where the Lone Woman was first seen. However, since Dittman observed three huts on the dune as he approached the Lone Woman, I cannot be certain that this is the precise spot where she was found. Future archeological excavations could reveal evidence that would securely pinpoint the exact location.\\nLearn about a whalebone hut found on San Nicolas Island.\\nAn official form of the United States government.

Vellanoweth, et al., “A Double Dog Burial from San Nicolas Island, California, USA: Osteology, Context, and Significance.” Journal of Archaeological Science 35, no. 12 (2008): 3115, 3122\\nThe visceral and rectal areas of Dog B contained only burned and unburned fish bones. That some of the stomach contents contained burned fish bone suggests these dogs ate the discarded remains of human food refuse, perhaps from direct scavenging of food refuse piles [middens], offal scavenging, or direct and deliberate feeding by humans….\\nOn the Channel Islands, dogs likely played an important role in helping humans hunt seals, sea lions, and birds and perhaps even assisted in fishing activities, having a direct impact on island plant and animal communities.'),\n",

The elephant seal is named for the large overhanging nose of adult males, which looks similar to an elephant’s trunk. The females are smaller in comparison, weighing about 2,000 pounds and growing to about 10 feet in length. Elephant seal fur ranges from silvery grey in pups to dark brown in adults.')]"
